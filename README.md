### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm a **Python** Developer and the creator of the website [python.study](https://python.study), as well as some interesting [Python projects](https://github.com/amerkurev/scrapper).

I also write articles about Python on [Medium](https://medium.com/@apps.merkurev).

In addition, I have a rich experience in C++ development from the past, and I dabble a bit in [Go as well](https://github.com/amerkurev/doku).

And when the need arises, and there's no one else to help, I can also write in JavaScript, although my main focus is **backend** development.
