### Hi there 👋 
I'm a **Python** Developer and the creator of the website [python.study](https://python.study), as well as some interesting [Python projects](https://github.com/amerkurev/scrapper).

I also write articles about Python on [Medium](https://medium.com/@apps.merkurev).

My recent posts:
- [Creating a Powerful Interactive CLI App with ChatGPT in Python](https://medium.com/ai-mind-labs/creating-a-powerful-interactive-cli-app-with-chatgpt-in-python-2e05dc4b33b2)
- [Subtle Aspects of Python's Generator Function](https://medium.com/ai-mind-labs/subtle-aspects-of-pythons-generator-function-3a244e197da)
- [Download large file in Python with beautiful progress bar](https://medium.com/ai-mind-labs/download-large-file-in-python-with-beautiful-progress-bar-f4f86b394ad7)

In addition, I have a rich experience in C++ development from the past, and I dabble a bit in [Go as well](https://github.com/amerkurev/doku).

And when the need arises, and there's no one else to help, I can also write in JavaScript, although my main focus is **backend** development.
